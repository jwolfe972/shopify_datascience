After doing a few calculations, it seems that they got the value that they received initially
from adding up the average amounts for each store then dividing them by 100. The mistake in this comes from
not considering the range of the highest average money making stores and the lowest average money making stores,
which is approximately $23,4938.6331. I believe that it is best to calculate the AOV by store and also by items bought. I do this because there is also a large range when it comes to the number of items in an order (1,999).

1b. I would report AOV by store by item amount then take the overall average. Or Overall AOV with respect to number of items bought for each store


1c. $407.99
